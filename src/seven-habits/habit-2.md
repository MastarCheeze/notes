# Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

## All things are created twice

First creation: mental (planning)
Second creation: physical (doing)

### Rescripting

> We are in change of both creations

We already live many scripts (first creations) handed to us.

If we don't become responsible for first creations,
we empower circumstances outside circle of influence to shape our lives.

## Center of a paradigm

The center is the source of life-support factors:
- Security: sense of worth
- Guidance: direction in life
- Wisdom: perspective and understanding
- Power: capacity to act

### Principle centers

> Foundation for life-support factors

- Correct principles do not change
- Fundamental truths
- Dependable

If we act based on principle centers:
1. We proactively choose the best decision
   (not acted upon by other people or circumstances)
2. The decision is effective
3. It contributes to our life values
4. We feel comfortable with the decision

## Two ways to tap the creative right brain

This impacts the quality of the first creation

### Expand perspective

Think about a big event (your wedding, retirement, funeral)
- What do you want to have done?
- What will you do afterwards?
- What's really important / what doesn't matter at all?

### Visualisation and affirmation

**Think of an affirmation about yourself.**
It has to be personal, present tense, positive and emotional.

**Visualise a scenario.**
Imagine how you'll handle it using the affirmation.

Next time you encounter it, you'll know what to do / won't be scared.

## Mission statement

### Personal

Contains your:
- Purpose
- Priorities
- Roles and goals

### Organisational

Core of the organisation

Involve everyone: no involvement, no commitment
