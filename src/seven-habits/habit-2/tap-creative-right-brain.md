# Two Ways to Tap the Creative Right Brain

This impacts the quality of the first creation

## Expand perspective

#### Think about a big event (your wedding, retirement, funeral)

- What do you want to have done?
- What will you do afterwards?
- What's really important / what doesn't matter at all?

**Think of an affirmation about yourself.**
It has to be personal, present tense, positive and emotional.

**Visualise a scenario.**
Imagine how you'll handle it using the affirmation.

Next time you encounter it, you'll know what to do / won't be scared.
