# First and Second Creations

> All things are created twice

First creation: mental (planning)
Second creation: physical (doing)

## Rescripting

> We are in change of both creations

We already live many scripts (first creations) handed to us.

If we don't become responsible for first creations,
we empower circumstances outside circle of influence to shape our lives.
