# Compression Algorithms

## Perceptual music shaping

> For audio (.mp3 & .mp4)
> **Lossy**

- Removes frequencies outside human hearing range
- If two sounds are played at once, remove softer sound

## JPEG compression

> For bitmap images (.jpeg)
> **Lossy**

- Quality reduced

## SVG compression

> For vector graphics (.svg)

- SVG files are defined as XML
- XML can be compressed

## Run Length Encoding (RLE)

> For anything
> **Lossless**

- Stores frequency of occurence & value
- Effective only when there are repeated patterns
