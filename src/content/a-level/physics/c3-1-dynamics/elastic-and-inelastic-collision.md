# Elastic Collision

> Total **kinetic energy** of objects is **conserved** before and after the collision (perfectly elastic)
> 
> $$\Sigma E_{ki} = \Sigma E_{kf}$$

> - Objects travelling in opposite directions: $v_1 + v_2$
> - Objects travelling in same direction: $v_2 - v_1$

Objects move apart after collision

#### Solving for final velocity of two objects given mass and initial velocity
1. Write equation using principle of conservation of momentum
2. Write equation using RSA = RSS
3. Solve simultaneous equations

# Inelastic Collision

> Total **kinetic energy** of objects is **not conserved** before and after the collision

Objects stick together after collision
