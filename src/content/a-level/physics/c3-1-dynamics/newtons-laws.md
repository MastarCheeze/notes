# Newton's Laws of Motion

## 1st Law

> An object will remain at rest or move at constant velocity (linear equilibrium), unless acted upon by an **resultant external force**.

If object is not moving, there is no resultant force

## 2nd Law

> The **resultant external force** acting on an object is equal to the **rate of change of [momentum](./momentum.md)** of the object.

$$
\begin{align*}
  F &= \frac{m(v-u)}{t} \\
  &= ma
\end{align*}
$$

## 3rd Law

> If object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts a force on object A of **equal magnitude** in the **opposite direction**.

Come in pairs
Have the same type (electromagnetic, gravitational, weak nuclear, strong nuclear)
Act on different bodies
