compressive deformation - squashed and shortened (repulsive force between molecules)
tensile deformation - stretched and lengthened (attractive force between molecules)

extension - increase in length of spring

Hooke's Law (measure of elasticity of object)
F=kx
extension against force applied graph, gradient is spring constant, area under graph is work done
Extension produced is directly proportional to the force applied (within the limit of proportionality)
spring constant / force constant k - large = stiff, small = elastic
Limit of proportionality - beyond this point, extension is no longer proportional to force
Elastic limit - beyond this point, spring is permanently deformed

Elastic potential energy
area under graph of extension against force = work done
  E=1/2 Fx if obey hookes law (area under triangle)
  E=1/2 kx * x
  E=1/2 kx^2
load/unload graph

Elastic deformation - return to original length, all energy recovered
Plastic deformation - does not return to original length, permanently deformed, some energy cannot be recovered

Strain (epsilon) - extension / original length (ratio, no unit) - e/l (ratio of change in length)
Stress (sigma) - normal force applied per unit cross sectional area (Pa, N m^-2) - F/A (force applied per unit area)
Young modulus (E) - measure of elasticity of material - stress / strain (Pa, N m^-2, typically MPa or GPa) - Fl/eA

when stress is proportional to strain, obeys Hooke's Law
graph of stress-strain - area = elastic potential energy (strain energy) per unit volume, gradient = young modulus
