# Deformation

## Compressive deformation

Squashed
Repulsive force between molecules

## Tensile deformation

Stretched
Attractive force between molecules

## Elastic deformation

When stress is removed, object **returns to its original length**

## Plastic deformation

When stress is removed, object is **permanently deformed**
