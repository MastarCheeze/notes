# Projectile Motion

![X and y components of projectile motion over time](/src/assets/images/a-level/physics/projectile-motion-components.png)

**Horizontal motion**: Speed is constant because there is no acceleration in this direction
**Vertical motion**: Speed is changing because there is gravity causing downward acceleration of $9.81 \unit{m\,s^{-1}}$
