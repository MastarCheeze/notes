# Terminal Velocity

#### In a free fall, the forces are:
- Weight - downwards
- Drag (air resistance) - upwards

<br>

1. Initially, acceleration = $9.81 \unit{m\,s^{-1}}$
   - There is α resultant force downwards
2. When velocity ⬆, drag ⬆
   - resultant force ⬇
   - acceleration ⬇
3. When weight = drag
   - resultant force = 0
   - acceleration = 0 &ensp; (Follows [Newton's Laws of Motion](./newtons-laws-of-motion.md#first-law))
   - **Terminal velocity** reached

*Note: Graph of $a$ is not a straight line because resultant force is constantly changing and $a=\frac{F}{m}$*
