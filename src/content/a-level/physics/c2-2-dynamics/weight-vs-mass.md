# Weight vs Mass

::::columns
:::
## Weight

Unit: Newton (N)
Definition: **Force of gravity acting on object**

- Changes with $g$
- Vector
- Is a force
:::
:::
## Mass

Unit: Kilogram (kg)
Definition: **Measure of inertia** (property that resists change in motion)

- Fixed
- Scalar

## Formula

> $$
> \begin{align*}
>   W &= mg \\
>   \mathrm{weight} &= \mathrm{mass \cdot gravitational~field~strength}
> \end{align*}
> $$
>
> Unit of $g$ = $\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$

## Centre of gravity

**Single point** where the **whole weight** of the object is considered to act at
