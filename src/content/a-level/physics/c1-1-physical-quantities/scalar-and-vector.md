## Vector operations

![Vector addition and subtraction](/src/assets/images/a-level/physics/vector-addition-subtraction.png)

**Addition**
Join both vectors <u>head to tail</u>,
draw line from a to b

**Subtraction**
Join both vectors <u>head to head</u>,
draw line from a to b (minuend to subtrahend)

## Vector resolution

Any vector can be represented by two *perpendicular* vector components

![Vector components](/src/assets/images/a-level/physics/vector-components.png)

Resolve **towards** angle: **cosine**
Resolve **away** from angle: **sine**
