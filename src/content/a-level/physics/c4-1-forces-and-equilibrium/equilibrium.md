# Equilibrium

> A system is in equilibrium if
> - Resultant force in any direction is zero ([Linear Equilibrium](../c3-1-dynamics/newtons-laws.md#1st-law))
> - Resultant moment at any point is zero ([Rotational Equilibrium](./moment-and-torque.md#principle-of-moments))

## Vector triangle

#### If 3 forces are not parallel and object is in equilibrium
- All forces must form a closed triangle
- All forces act through a single point
