# Moment

> Unit of $M$ = $\mathrm{N\,m}$

If force applied is not perpendicular, either [resolve](../c1-1-physical-quantities/scalar-and-vector.md#vector-resolution) distance or resolve forces

#### Note
- Moment - distance perpendicular to force
- Work - distance parallel to force

## Principle of moments

> A system is in rotational equilibrium if

> $$\text{sum of clockwise moments} = \text{sum of anticlockwise moments}$$

## Centre of gravity

**Single point** where the **whole [weight](../c3-1-dynamics/weight-vs-mass.md)** of the object is considered to act at
