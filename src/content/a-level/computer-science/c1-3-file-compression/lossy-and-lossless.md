title: Lossy and Lossless Compression
---

# Lossy

> **Compression algorithm**
> Reduce file size by **permanently** removing data

Lossy
- :bullet[✅] More compression
  - Less storage space
  - Faster transmission
  - Less bandwidth
- :bullet[❌] Quality lost

# Lossless

> **Compression algorithm**
> Reduce file size without **permanently** removing data
> Original file can be restored

Lossless
- :bullet[❌] Less compression
  - More storage space
  - Slower transmission
  - More bandwidth
- :bullet[✅] Quality preserved
- :bullet[✅] Can edit original file
