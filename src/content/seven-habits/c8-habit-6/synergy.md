# Synergy

> The whole > the sum of its parts

When people work together in a way that combines unique strengths and perspectives
to create outcomes that are better than what any individual could achieve

Parties involved will learn mutually and gain insight
This excitement will create momentum towards more learning, insights and growth

## Valuing the Differences

A person who is truly effective can:
- Recognise his own perceptual limitations
- Appreciate the resources available through interaction with others

Differences unite, not polarise
Differences in opinions is an opportunity, not a threat
Communicate with someone because not because they agree with you, but because they see differently than you do
