# Emotional Bank Account

> Amount of trust that's been built up in a relationship

Deposits: gain trust and gain flexibility
Withdrawals: lose trust and create tension

## Six major deposits

#### 1. Understanding the individual

What is important to another person must be as important to you as the other person is to you
Do unto others as you would have others do unto you

#### 2. Attending to little things

Little kindnesses / courtesies make a big difference

#### 3. Keeping commitments

People build hopes around promises, always keep them
Never make a promise you cant keep

#### 4. Clarifying expectations

Discuss implicit expectations explicitly
Prevent enlarging simple misunderstandings

#### 5. Showing personal integrity

Conforming reality to your words (mean what you speak)
Treat everyone by the same set of principles

Example: Be loyal to those who are not present

#### 6. Apologising sincerely when you make a withdrawal

Apology must be sincere
Requires deep sense of security in fundamental principles
