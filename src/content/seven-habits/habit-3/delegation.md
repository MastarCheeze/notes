# Stewardship Delegation

> Delegation is *effectiveness*

Focus on results instead of methods
Trust is the highest form of human motivation

### Requires mutual understanding of 5 things:

#### Desired results
- What needs to be accomplished
- What will it look like
- When will it be done

#### Guidelines
- Point out what **not** to do (failure paths) instead of what to do
- Keep restrictions as little as possible

#### Resources
- Person can draw on these to accomplish result
- Examples:
  - Human
  - Financial
  - Technical
  - Organisational

#### Accountability
- Standards of performance (criteria) used for evaluation
- Dates/times of evaluation

#### Consequences
- What will happen after evaluation (both good and bad)
- Examples:
  - Financial rewards
  - Psychic rewards
  - Job assignments
  - Natural consequences


### Adapting to different kinds of persons

#### Immature

- Fewer desired results
- More guidelines
- Identify more resources
- Conduct more frequent accountability interviews
- More immediate consequences

#### Mature

- More challenging desired results
- Fewer guidelines
- Less frequent accountability
- Less measurable but more discernable criteria
